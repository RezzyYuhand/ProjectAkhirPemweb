                Deforestation in Indonesia hits record low, but experts fear a
                rebound
              </h1>
              <p>
                JAKARTA — Indonesia's deforestation rate hit a historic low in
                2020, with the government crediting its various policies
                prohibiting forest-clearing, and experts attributing the trend
                to more rains, falling oil palm prices, and an economic slowdown
                as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.<br /><br />
                The country lost 115,459 hectares (285,300 acres) of forest
                cover in 2020, an area the size of Los Angeles. That's a 75%
                drop from 2019, according to the Ministry of Environment and
                Forestry.<br /><br />
                “In the past, we've often said that our deforestation [rate] was
                in the millions [of hectares],” said Belinda Arunarwati Margono,
                the ministry's director of forest resource monitoring. But the
                2020 deforestation rate, she said, “is remarkable for us because
                this is the lowest deforestation figure that we've ever
                achieved.”

              Deforestation in Indonesia and its impact on the environment
            </h1>
            <p>
              The primary cause of deforestation in Indonesia is the expansion
              of agriculture. Indonesia is the world's largest palm oil
              producer, and the industry has rapidly expanded, leading to
              extensive land clearing for palm oil plantations. The logging
              industry is also a significant contributor to deforestation, with
              illegal logging occurring in many protected areas. Additionally,
              mining activities, such as coal and gold mining, have led to the
              destruction of large areas of forests and the pollution of
              waterways.<br /><br />
              The loss of forest cover in Indonesia significantly impacts the
              environment, biodiversity, and local communities. Deforestation
              leads to soil erosion, which reduces soil fertility, making it
              harder for crops to grow. Indonesia's deforestation problem also
              affects its biodiversity. The country is home to many endangered
              species, such as orangutans, tigers, and elephants. The loss of
              forests and habitat destruction threatens these species' survival,
              and many have become critically endangered. The destruction of
              forests also affects the livelihoods of local communities that
              rely on forests for food, medicine, and income.

            <h1>Indonesian Forests & Palm Oil</h1>
            <p>
              In Indonesia, forests and peatlands are also cleared to create
              monoculture pulp and paper plantations to grow tissue, paper, and
              packaging.<br /><br />
              Greenpeace Southeast Asia and network wide global offices over the
              years focused on two major pulp and paper companies: Asia Pulp and
              Paper and APRIL, whose paper products reach corporations around
              the world from toilet paper, candy wrappers, and office
              supplies.<br />
              In 2018, a Greenpeace International investigation revealed a
              massive illegal logging operation in the critical orangutan
              habitat landscape in West Kalimantan. Photos taken by Greenpeace
              Indonesia in March 2018 reveal at least six illegal logging
              settlements inside the PT Mohairson Pawan Khatulistiwa (MPK)
              concession in Sungai Putri, a 57,000 hectare peatland forest and
              one of the last orangutan strongholds in the world.<br /><br />
              Despite Forest Conservation Policies, certifications and the
              proliferation of “no deforestation commitments,” the industry is
              still responsible for ongoing and widespread deforestation.
